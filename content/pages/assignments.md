Students are required to write one short paper and one longer paper in the course. Students select from a list of topics for the first paper. The second paper topic is chosen by the student in consultation with the professor or teaching assistant.

First Paper Topics
------------------

Write about 6 double-spaced pages on **one** of the following questions:

1.  Would we be better off without alcohol?
2.  What makes for an unhealthy relationship with a substance?
3.  How has capitalism changed patterns of drug use?
4.  The anthropologist Marlene Dobkin de Rios writes: "the sacred and reverent utilization of psychoactive substances among tribal peoples has been transformed by Western industrial societies into a profaned and pathological phenomenon." Comparing what you have read and heard of hallucinogenic drug use in "primitive" societies and in the U.S., do you agree with de Rios that the latter has been unhealthy and dysfunctional where the former was not?
